        <h4 class="headers-sets">Faith comes by hearing</h4>
        <p>People fail when they are more interested in doing than in hearing. Faith doesn't come by doing, it comes by hearing.
          Everything God wants to do on the earth must first be spoken; it is the duty of everyone to hear.
          The hearer can overtake the preacher, because faith doesn't come by speaking but by hearing

        <h4 class="headers-sets">True love</h4>
        <p>True love is not in the feeling or in talk. It is in action. You don't know you love the Lord until you make choices because of Him.
          The only proof of the sincerity of love for the Lord is in actions. Affection has expulsive power.
           True love for Him will make you refuse to do things you would have wanted to do and refuse to own what you would have wanted to own.
          Do I love the Lord? I can only tell by how i have been making my decisions.</p>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">The word is alive</h4>
        <p>Obedience to the word of God is automatic if attention to the word is deliberate and intensive.
           You actually do not act on the word; it is the word that acts on you. Remember It is the Word that is living and active.
        What does it mean to believe? It means to look at the word of God attentively, expectantly, with a steady and absorbing gaze.
         It means to thus allow the word to act on you.</p>
        <h5 class="text-end fonts-name">Pastor Bankie</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">True faith is</h4>
        <p>Faith is about knowing God and waiting for Him. By faith I understand what is important in life.
           Faith is not how I get a house and a car or more money. Rather faith tells me that my life does not consist in the abundance of things which I possess.
           By faith I am able to love less those things. I don't pray about them like my life depends on them;
           I use my faith to understand how much my life doesn't depend on them. I am able to understand they are just tools that God gives me to execute
           His purpose on the earth. He will give me all I need.
        That is the first assignment of faith.</p>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">To be led by the Spirit</h4>
        <p>The number one way the Spirit of God leads is to teach us the fear of God. Every decision point has what is the fear of God.
          Learn it, do it, and you'll end up doing the will of God in every situation.
        The manifestation of every promise of God for us in Christ is tied to our progressive perfection of holiness (2 Cor 7.1, 2 Pet 1.8) </p>

      </div>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">Why resist?</h4>
        <p>A major reason you resist temptation is to disarm the devil. Every temptation is to empower either the devil or the power of God in your life.
          Falling for it empowers the devil in your life, and resisting it releases blessings from God.</p>
        <h5 class="text-end fonts-name">Pastor Bankie</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">The demand of grace</h4>
        <p>Grace does not reduce God's demand for obedience, it actually heightens it. But grace makes obedience more possible. Grace does not excuse evil
          works, rather it cleans us up from all defilement.
          Jesus came with abundance of grace. If you are walking in sin, you haven't received His grace in truth. The first thing a Christian reigns over is
          temptation and sin. Sin no longer has dominion over a true believer. Rom 5:17</p>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">Security for the future</h4>
        <p>Anyone telling you that you can by yourself plan security for your life or that of your children is selling you over to the control of Satan. There is security only in God.
          Trust God, live by faith and leave it there. He will take care of the rest. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">Freedom and Boundaries</h4>
        <p>Excessive freedom is bondage disguised. Everything in life has boundaries. Adam and Eve had everything in the garden EXCEPT the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. No matter what God has given you,
          there is a boundary that you must not cross otherwise you lose everything. Wisdom is to learn the boundaries of things you feel so free about. </p>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">Real pleasure, Henry Ford</h4>
        <p>There is a pleasure in feeling that you have made others happy-that you have lessened in some degree the burdens of your fellow-men that you have provided a margin out of which may be had pleasure and saving.
          Good-will is one of the few really important assets of life.
           A determined man can win almost anything that he goes after, but unless, in his getting, he gains good will he has not profited much. </p>
        <h5 class="text-end fonts-name">Henry Ford</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">Foundation of real business, Henry Ford</h4>
        <p>My own short experience, together with what I saw going on around me, was quite enough proof that business as a mere money-making game was not worth giving much thought to and was distinctly no place for a man who wanted to accomplish anything.
           For the only foundation of real business is service.</p>
        <h5 class="text-end fonts-name">Henry Ford</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">Money and Service</h4>
        <p>Being greedy for money is the surest way not to get it, but when one serves for the
          sake of service - for the satisfaction of doing that which one believes to be right - then money abundantly takes care of itself. Money comes naturally as the result of service. And it is absolutely necessary to have money.
          But we do not want to forget that the end of money is not ease but the opportunity to perform more service.
          In my mind nothing is more abhorrent than a life of ease. None of us has any right to ease. </p>
        <h5 class="text-end fonts-name">Henry Ford</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">Are Men Equal, Henry Ford</h4>
        <p>There can be no greater absurdity and no greater disservice to humanity in general than to insist that all men are equal.
          Most certainly all men are not equal, and any democratic conception which strives to make men equal is only an effort to block progress. Men cannot be of equal service. The men of larger ability are less numerous than the men of smaller ability;
          it is possible for a mass of the smaller men to pull the larger ones down - but in so doing they pull themselves down.
          It is the larger men who give the leadership to the community and enable the smaller men to live with less effort  </p>

      </div>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">A wife</h4>
        <p>A wife is a companion by covenant. She is not your inferior in any way but a joint-heir with you, equal in every degree.
          She is not subordinate because of inferiority but because of the need to have the proper flow of power in the home.
          Her role is that of a second-in-command; before God her position is just as important as yours and her personality is as unique as yours.
          Her reward will be determined by how well she fulfills her function while yours will also be determined by how well you fulfill yours.
          You are not, as a man, constitutionally better than her at all.</p>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">Habitual sower of seed, Bankie</h4>
        <p>The doing of good must be continuous, and then the due time will come. You cannot give once to get the widow of Zarephath’s harvest.
          Giving a certain offering to get a certain harvest is most of the time a waste of time and money.
          If you are not ready to be a habitual sower, don’t bother starting because it will not help you</p>
        <h5 class="text-end fonts-name">Pastor Bankie</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">The Word and you, Bankie</h4>
        <p>If your life is different from what the word describes, that does not make the word of God faulty; it only means that your life needs to be rearranged.
          Your life and experience do not at all validate or invalidate the word of God. If you accept the word, it will create for you a whole new set of experiences.
          The Bible says that God calls those things that are not as though they were.
          That means that when God is speaking, he is not trying to describe situations, he is creating them.</p>
        <h5 class="text-end fonts-name">Pastor Bankie</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">Faithful outside</h4>
        <p>The way by which our Master, Christ Jesus, judges us is first from what we are doing in our secular jobs. We cannot feign faithfulness to God by doing well in
          church because He really does not look there; He would have first looked at your attitude at your secular jobs before anything else.</p>
        <h5 class="text-end fonts-name">Pastor Bankie</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">To be transformed, Pastor Bankie</h4>
        <p>To be transformed into the image of Christ is the main work that we have to do as believers. When we realize this,
          our approach to the things of God will be different. Please you must understand that what the Lord really wants from us is to see that everyday,
          progressively, we are getting closer to that image of Christ.
          It must be continual and we must see it as a mission. Paul saw it as a mission, something to be pursued with vigour.</p>
        <h5 class="text-end fonts-name">Pastor Bankie</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">Learning</h4>
        <p>Learning is the foundation of real spiritual work; our first emphasis must be to learn. It must not be activity.
          Jesus said the way by which you take His yoke upon you is by learning of Him. As you learn of the Lord, His Spirit is transferred into your heart
          so that you will be able to do the work that is pleasing to God. God does not like surprises, even if it is motivated by what you think is love for God.
          The fact is that love for God is defined by obedience. You cannot do anything strange and think that you will impress Him.
          Everything you do for God must be as He commanded and as His Spirit inside you stimulates, otherwise it is not acceptable to Him.</p>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">The foundation of working for God</h4>
        <p>The foundation of working for God is to learn of Him, to get to know Him and become like Him. This is what is lacking most times among those who want to work in churches.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="i-div">
        <h4 class="headers-sets">Ministry, Pastor Bankie</h4>
        <p>Ministry is not just about healing the sick and raising the dead and shouting ‘repent’ from the rooftops; there is ministry in every sphere of life.
          It is ministry to live a honest and decent life; to abhor what is evil and to succeed despite not being crooked.
          I am in ministry when I focus on putting excellence into my secular work and to work with God therein until the manifestation of God appears therein.</p>

        <h4 class="headers-sets">Worshipping in the spirit</h4>
        <p>Worshipping in the spirit does not at all imply that you have lost control, are ‘lost in the spirit’, or that you are speaking in other tongues.
          Many believe that worship is in the spirit only when unusual things are happening and people are falling under the influence of the power of God.
          No No! O yes there are times of worship when you will become lost to the natural realm and indeed it will appear like things are out of your control,
          but that is not the only time that you are worshipping in spirit. To worship in spirit is to do things out of personal persuasion and out of a deep relationship.
          That is what God is seeking.</p>

          I seem like a man that has his goal in sight on some mountain side, but thre lies between a misty valley where fog covers all from his eyes, as he passes through them, as he crossed the river form whence they arise.
          Going on, going on, watching,, praying and working is all I can do,certain that whatever happens I shall get out on the right side; but I will not turn back because I can’t see all I would like of the road before me.</p>

        <p>Your body is tired the moment your spirit is discouraged. Your body breaks down under it. As long as your spirit is triumphant, you are a victor and you can go right on. A man is defeated only when he is defeated in spirit.
          When he loses courage he is whipped. The only way to put the man back on his feet again is to renew a right spirit within him.</p>
