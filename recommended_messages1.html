    <p><strong>Text: John 1:1-5; Phil. 2:8-11</strong></p>
    <p><strong>MEMORY VERSE:	“Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever.”	Hebrew 13:8</strong></p></div>
    <p>“Jesus the same yesterday, today and forever”</p>
    <p>Jesus never change, His power never diminish, The way He has been operating in power and might effectively, the same way He is still operating and shall continue to operate until the time of grace will cease.</p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li><p>JESUS AS THE WORD OF GOD: John 1:1-5; 14; Gen. 1:1-3</p></li>
        <p>Jesus has being right from eternity. His power was seen in the creation. The word that God spoke at creation was power and this word was Jesus just as it is confirmed in John 1:1-3. The efficacy of Jesus caused the earth to emerge from the water, the efficacy of Jesus brought in; time, day and season, it’s also brought into life all living being including human being.</p>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2" type="1">

    </ol>
    2.	JESUS WITH ISRAELITES IN THE WILDERNESS: 1Cor. 10:1-4</p>
    The efficacy of Jesus manifested greatly in the midst of the Israelites when they were out of Egypt to Canaan Land. The bitterness of their lives that was symbolized with Marah was taken away through Jesus Exo. 15:25. The angelic food they ate (Manna) was Jesus John 6:31-33 from 1Cor. 10:1-4, we can see that Jesus was with the Israelites throughout their journey in the wilderness. The water they drank was Jesus. The protection they received was through Jesus. The snake of bronze that was lifted up for the healing of those bitten by snake was through Jesus Num. 21:8-9; and this symbolizes the medium through which the world will be saved through Jesus death by nailing Him to the cross. (John 3:14).</p>
    Jesus also made Himself known to Joshua and the Israelites at Gilgal as the captain of the host of God, who indeed fought and conquered the land of Canaan for them. Joshua 5:13-15</p>
    3.	JESUS IN THE FLESH</p>
    The efficacy of power of Jesus was fully demonstrated when Jesus was in the flesh. The evidence of this were so many; but few will be mentioned.</p>
    -	The greatest and the most difficult miracle that man can have is the salvation of his soul. This was achieved by our Lord Jesus Christ i.e the salvation of the disciples and the seventy that believes on Him (Luke 10:17, 18 & 20).</p>
    -	The salvation of Zaccheaus Lk. 19:8-10. The salvation of Mary Magdalene out of which seven demons were cast out and at last became saved (Lk. 7:44-48; John 11:1)</p>
    -	Miracle of healing and deliverances:</p>
    -	Mad man of Gadara (Mark 5:1-5, 13-15)
    -	Blind man from birth (John 9:6-7)
    -	Woman of issues of blood (Matt. 9:20-22)
    -	38years sick man (John 5:5-9)
    -	Dead Lazarus raised back to life (John 11:38-44)
    -	Dead son of the widow of Nain (Luke 7:11-15)
    -	Dead daughter of Jirus (Lk 8:49-50, 54-55)
    -	Daughter of Syro-phoenican women delivered (Mar 7:24-30)
    -	Leper cleansed Mt. 8:2-4; Lk. 17:11-13
    -	Jesus walked on the sea Mk. 6:48-50
    -	What of miracle of multiplication Mt. 15:32-37
    -	Drought of fish Lk. 5:1-6
    Jesus’ power and the Apostles
        Jesus said more than what He did we will do. This manifested in the days of the Apostles and it is still manifesting even now.
    -	Miracle of salvation happened when Peter delivered his first message which gave birth to three thousand souls at once. Act 2:40-41
    -	Evangelist Philip took over Samaria for Jesus when he went there to preach and many gave their lives to Christ. Act 8:5-7, 12-13
    -	The Eunuch of Ethiopian also became born again as Philip explained the scripture to him. Act 8:35-38
    -	Dead Tabitha came to life as Peter prayed in the name of Jesus Act. 9:36-41
    -	40 years old Lame man became whole through Peter and John at the name of Jesus Act 3:2, 6-8
    -	The shadow of Peter healed the sick folks. Act 5:12, 14-16
    -	Demons were cast out by Apostle Paul. Act 16:16-18; 19:13-15
    -	Cripple man made whole again by Paul and Barnabas at Lystra Act 14:8-10
    -	Aprons from Paul were taken and laid on the sick and they were made whole. Act 19:11-12
    -	So many things, infact many signs and wonders followed up the preaching of the Apostles.
    -	Among the contemporary believers, we have people like Apostle Ayo Babalola. That God used several times to raise dead people, healed so many people from incurable diseases.
    -	So also Evangelist Reinerd Bonke whom God also used to bring dead man to life.
    The efficacy of Jesus is still in place if you and I can readily make ourselves available for Him (Jesus) to use. Jesus is the same He never changed Heb. 13:8
