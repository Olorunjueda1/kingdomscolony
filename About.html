        <p class="para-about">
          The kingdom (kingdom of God) targets on earth; thus God’s kingdom is God Himself coming down to man (Jesus Christ the God-Man) to impacts, influences and changes earth to heaven on earth. “Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” Matthew 6:10. Base on this, the vision of Kingdom’s Colony Evangelical Ministry (a.k.a The Centre of His Power) is to see the customs and the tradition of God’s kingdom practiced here on earth. Our vision is to ever see ourselves as pilgrims and strangers on earth waiting and seeking for God’s kingdom to come. We live to manifest the love of the kingdom to the King of kings, to ourselves and to the world around us. We live to manifest kingdom’s holiness and righteousness through the righteousness of His Son Jesus Christ. We live to manifest Kingdom’s Power through the word of God in our mouth by calling unto God in the name of Jesus Christ. Our vision is to get us rooted in the undiluted word of God as declared by God through His Law and Prophets which is fulfilled in our Lord Jesus Christ and confirmed by Him and through His Apostles (Complete Bible Doctrine). Col 2:6-8; Eph. 3:16-19 Furthermore, to see that we are complete in Him (Christ) by accessing kingdom’s blessing here on earth. (Matthew 6:33). By manifesting kingdom’s power on earth Lk. 11:19-20; Matt 12:28 By living a life of dominion over sin Rom 6:14; I John 3:9 By manifesting God’s glory on earth in all area of life Col. 1:27; Deut. 8:18; III John 2; Psa 139:14.

            According to dictionary meaning. This is a settlement of emigrants who move to a new place, but remain culturally tied to their original place. In the world setting, a country is governed directly by the country that colonized her. Therefore, the laws, customs and traditions of that country that colonized another are imposed upon the colonized state. But colony in the context of this setting is the coming together of those that sees themselves as strangers and pilgrims on earth who indeed are seeking for the real kingdom from where they emanated. But while still on earth, they lives by practicing the principle of the kingdom from where they comes. Ever applying the rules, laws, customs and the traditions of the kingdom they emanated from. Hebrews 11:13-16 Therefore, the king (The supreme ruler) of the this kingdom is God Himself and the kingdom is heaven but brought down to earth by those that are from the kingdom of heaven who are still living here on earth. This they are doing by subjecting themselves to the supreme ruler (king) of the kingdom of heaven while still on earth. Jesus said “Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” Matt 6:10 The Evangelical aspect of the ministry is the sharing of the good news of the kingdom of God they are enjoying on earth with people since God is the source and the Creator of every human being. Though man has fallen from grace, yet He says He did not want the death of sinners but sinners to come to repentance (Eze 18:23; II Peter 3:9). To achieve this, He gave the life of His only begotten Son (Jesus) as a ransom for the souls of men (John 3:16). Thus, He commanded all that believes in Him, by accepting Him into their lives as the Lord and Saviour to go and preach the gospel of the kingdom of God to all nations and tribes of the world and He promised to be with them till the end of the age (Matthew 28:19-20). He also commissioned them to demonstrate the power of the kingdom of God, through the Holy Spirit that is in them over the problems of the people they preached to by healing their sickness, casting out demons out of them and if at all they are attacked at the course of their service by drinking poison, the power of God in them will make it of no effect and if they march on serpent, it will not bite them (Mark 16:16-18).

            Jesus came to the world as God-Man to restore back the kingdom that man lost to Satan in the Garden of Eden Genesis 3:1-7; John 8:12; 9:5 The glory that was lost by Adam as a result of the fall was what Jesus came to the world to recover back for man.
